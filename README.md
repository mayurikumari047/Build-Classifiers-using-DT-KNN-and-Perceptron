# Build-Classifiers-using-DT-KNN-and-Perceptron
Building classifiers using decision trees, nearest neighbors, and Perceptron, to make decisions on different datasets.

This project is part of one of the homework of Introduction to Machine Learning course.

### Description of files used for this project.

dumbClassifiers.py: This contains a handful of "warm up" classifiers to get used to classification framework.

dt.py: Will be your simple implementation of a decision tree classifier.

knn.py: This is where your nearest-neighbor classifier modifications will go.

perceptron.py: The perceptron file you need to edit.

binary.py: Our generic interface for binary classifiers (actually works for regression and other types of classification, too).

datasets.py: Where a handful of test data sets are stored.

util.py: A handful of useful utility functions: these will undoubtedly be helpful to you, so take a look!

runClassifier.py: A few wrappers for doing useful things with classifiers, like training them, generating learning curves, etc.

mlGraphics.py: A few useful plotting commands

data/*: all of the datasets we'll use.
